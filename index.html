        <p>Nikola Tesla was a scientist whose inventions include the Tesla coil, alternating-current (AC) electricity,
            and the discovery of the rotating magnetic field. Who Was Nikola Tesla? Nikola Tesla was an engineer and
            scientist known for designing the alternating-current (AC) electric system, which is the predominant
            electrical system used across the world today. He also created the "Tesla coil," which is still used in
            radio technology. Born in modern-day Croatia, Tesla came to the United States in 1884 and briefly worked
            with Thomas Edison before the two parted ways. He sold several patent rights, including those to his AC
            machinery, to George Westinghouse.</p>
